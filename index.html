Hi! I am an aspiring Data Scientist who recently finished my Masters at UC Davis in Statistics.
I attended UC Davis as both an undergrad and as a Masters student.
During my undergrad, I worked as an ML and DS intern at Vuemix, 
a Student Researcher at the School of Education,
and a Computer Room Consultant at UC Davis IET. 
While in my Masters, I worked as an analyst at <a href="https://www.sacog.org/">SACOG</a>.
I love researching and applying data science and machine learning to different environments and mediums.<br><br>


I was born in Oakland and grew up in the bay. In my free time,
I love keeping active with basketball, ping pong, climbing, and swimming.
I also enjoy keeping my mind sharp through woodworking,
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/203322175@N04/">photography</a>, sewing, reading
(novels and manga), and sudoku. I'm also a huge live music fan and have seen Japanese Breakfast at 8+ concerts!<br><br>
