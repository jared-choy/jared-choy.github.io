<br> Hi! I am an aspiring Data Scientist who recently finished my Masters at UC Davis in Statistics. I attended UC Davis as both an 
undergrad and Masters student. During my undergrad I worked as a ML and DS intern at Vuemix, a Student Researcher at the 
School of Education, and a Computer Room Consultant at UC Davis IET. While in my Masters, I worked
as an analyst over at the <a href="https://www.sacog.org/">Sacramento Area Council of Governments</a>.
I love researching and applying data science and machine learning to different environments and mediums.<br><br>

I was born in Oakland and grew up in the bay. In my free time, I love keeping active,
whether that's: basketball, ping pong, climbing, or swimming.
Besides being physically active, I love keeping my mind sharp by woodworking,
photography, sewing, reading (novels and manga), and sudoku. I also love live music,
and have seen Japanese Breakfast 8+ concerts times!<br><br>

Thank you for taking the time to read through my website ^_^
