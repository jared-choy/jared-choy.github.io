## Background
Hi! I am an aspiring Data Scientist who recently finished my Masters at UC Davis in Statistics.
I attended UC Davis as both an undergrad and as a Masters student. 
In my Masters, I thoroughly enjoyed studying probability theory, algorithmic design, model development, and optimization theory. 
During my undergrad, I worked as an ML and DS intern at <em>Vuemix</em>, 
a Student Researcher at the <em>UC Davis School of Education</em>,
and a Computer Room Consultant at <em>UC Davis IET</em>. 
While in my Masters, I worked as an analyst at the <em>Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG)</em>. 
I love researching and applying data science and machine learning to different environments and mediums.<br><br>

## About
I was born in Oakland and grew up in the Bay Area. In my free time,
I love keeping active with basketball, ping pong, climbing, and swimming.
I also enjoy keeping my mind sharp through woodworking,

(novels and manga), and sudoku. I'm also a huge live <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/SeolHaeJuan">music fan</a>
and have seen Japanese Breakfast at 8+ concerts!
