### My story

Hi! I am twenty-two years old, born in Oakland, and grew up in the Bay. I did my undergrad at UC Davis from 2021 to 2023, and then I went on to do my Masters there as well. I finished my program back in December of 2024; simultaneously, I was also working as an analyst over at the [Sacramento Area Council of Governments](https://www.sacog.org/) all throughout my Masters. In my program, I completed the Data Science track which focused heavily on data science concepts, modelling, and optimization theory. 

In my free time, I love keeping active, whether that's: basketball, ping pong, climbing, or swimming. Besides being physically active, I love keeping my mind sharp by woodworking, photography, sewing, reading (novels and manga), and sudoku. I also love live music, and have seen Japanese Breakfast 8+ concerts times!
