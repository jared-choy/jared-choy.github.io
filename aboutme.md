### My story

Hi! I am twenty-two years old, born in Oakland, and grew up in the Bay. I did my undergrad at UC Davis from 2021 to 2023, and then I went on to do my Masters there as well. I finished my program back in December of 2024; simultaneously, I was also working as an analyst over at the [Sacramento Area Council of Governments](https://www.sacog.org/). I left SACOG in April to go travel the Balkans, Southeast Asia, and East Asia for four months.
